# SPARQL Queries for Ontology Validation

This folder contains the set of SPARQL queries used to test and validate the expressiveness of the ontology through Competency Questions (CQs).

These queries align with the main legal obligations of the EU AI Act, especially in the context of high-risk AI systems. Each query answers a specific compliance-related question derived from the mapped requirements.

## File:

- `competency_questions_queries.md`:  
  Contains seven competency questions (CQ1â€“CQ7), each with its corresponding SPARQL query. These queries were used to verify whether the ontology could support reasoning about:
  - Risk categorization
  - Conformity assessments
  - Post-market obligations
  - Declared changes
  - Technical documentation and registration

The results of these queries were used to assess the practical applicability of the ontology in compliance contexts.
