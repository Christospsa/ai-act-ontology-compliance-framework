# Reusable Semantic Elements
This folder contains reusable ontology elements and templates developed to support compliance modeling in accordance with EU AI Act. These elements have a semantic basis and are structured to ensure interoperability, traceability and reusability.

## Contents:

### semantic reuse.xlsx
This spreadsheet offers a curated mapping of selected AI Act requirements (e.g., from Articles and Annexes) to reusable ontology elements. Each row includes:

The relevant AI Act Requirement and Article reference

The Requirement Type (e.g., Risk, Accountability, Documentation)

Candidate Ontology (e.g., DPV, ODRL, GDPRov)

A proposed Candidate Concept

Explanatory Notes

Recommended Type (Class, Data Property, Object Property)

### semantic_reuse_snippets_examples.ttl
This Turtle file provides examples of how to apply the reusable elements defined in the spreadsheet. It shows how to create snapshots of classes, properties and constraints using terms from ODRL, DPV and GDPRov, adapted where necessary. These examples are designed to be integrated into broader compliance ontologies or extended for specific use cases.
