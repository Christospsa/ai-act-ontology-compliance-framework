# Mapping Table for Ontology Development

This folder contains the structured mapping used to guide the development of the ontology-based compliance framework for the EU AI Act.

## Files Included:

- `Articles.xlsx`: A reference list of all AI Act articles used for traceability during ontology construction.
- `Categories.xlsx`: Thematic classification of obligations (e.g., Risk, Documentation, Compliance).
- `full mapping table.xlsx`: A detailed mapping that connects specific legal requirements to ontology concepts, supporting modular and semantically traceable modeling.

Each file plays a role in aligning regulatory text with ontology design decisions.
